## [0.4.0] - 2025-08-09

### üöÄ **MAJOR UPGRADE: SKU AUTO-LOOKUP!**
- **SKU-Based Items**: Changed from Item UID to SKU (Item Number) - much more user-friendly!

### Added
- **SKU Auto-Lookup**: Automatically converts SKU to MYOB Item UID via API call

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Item UID field changed to SKU (Item Number) field
- **Field Name**: "Item UID" ‚Üí "SKU (Item Number)"
